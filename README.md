[Part One](/Assignment Three/Problem-One.html) of this assignment utilizes JavaScript to produce a table based on user input. IT allows the use to add names and a score for each and then calculates the total number of names and the average score among them.

[Part Two](/Assignment Three/Problem-Two.html) uses JavaScript methods to add two 2-D arrays together, so long as they are both the same length and have the same length on each row. It uses the ".toSource()" method so be sure to run using Firefox as this seems to be the only Browser supporting it.

[Part Three](/Assignment Three/Problem-Three.html) uses JavaScript to prompt the user for names and then multiple transactions for each name entered. After the user is finished, the data is then used to populate a table and the final balance for each name entered is calculated and displayed in a seperate table.

[Part Four](/Assignment Three/Problem-Four.html) uses JavaScript to prompt the user for a string of words without any punctuation. It then splits the string up and creates an array of the words. This array is then used to create an object where each word is a key and the number of times it appears is its value.
